Crow\+Move is a small program which aims to observe in real life the movement of a population of crows in the Paris region

In this documentation you can find information about how the program work, that is to say the classes and their method, as well as the functions. Do not hesitate to check the README.\+md to find out how to compile and use this simple program.

This program is originaly meant to be used in an embedded machine but you can use it without it. Again, check README.\+md\hypertarget{index_introduction}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_introduction}
The goal is to create a program that is capable of retrieving the data from a specific study from move\+Bank database (movebank.\+org) and use a simple library as GD to plot on a map the detail of the movement of a small population of crow from Paris region. NOTE \+: With some modification it can be used with any study you want as it is made modular and extensible. \hypertarget{index_architecture}{}\doxysection{Architecture}\label{index_architecture}

On the graph \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The blue line mean today (day of execution) movement.
\item The black line mean yesterday
\item The Red line shades mean from bright red (2 day ago) to light red (7 day ago)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The output of the graph come with two form \+: all population together map and individual map
