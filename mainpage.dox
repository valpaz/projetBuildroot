/**
 * @mainpage Welcome to CrowMove documentation
 *
 * CrowMove is a small program which aims to observe in real life the movement of a population of crows in the Paris region
 *
 * In this documentation you can find information about how the program work, that is to say the classes and their method, as well as the functions.
 * Do not hesitate to check the README.md to find out how to compile and use this simple program. 
 *
 * This program is originaly meant to be used in an embedded machine but you can use it without it. Again, check README.md
 * 
 * @section introduction Introduction
 *
 * The goal is to create a program that is capable of retrieving the data from a specific study from moveBank database (movebank.org) and use a simple library as GD to plot on a map the detail of the
 * movement of a small population of crow from Paris region. NOTE : With some modification it can be used with any study you want
 * as it is made modular and extensible.
 * @section architecture Architecture
 *
 * Voici un sch√©ma de l'architecture de Mon Projet :
 *
 * @image html ./image_repository/diagram.png "how the file are created"
 *
 * @section graph Graph ouput exemples
 *
 * On the graph :
 * - The blue line mean today (day of execution) movement.
 * - The black line mean yesterday
 * - The Red line shades mean from bright red (2 day ago) to light red (7 day ago)
 *
 * The output of the graph come with two form : all population together map and individual map 
 *
 * @image html ./image_repository/allPopulation1.png "All the individual put together on the map"

 * @image html ./image_repository/oneIndividual1.png "Only one individual on the map"
 *
